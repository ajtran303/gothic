# Gothic Corpus

A Gothic Literature data set for Natural Language Processing.

## What is Gothic Literature?

Gothic literature is derived from the Romantic literary movement in the 19th century. For more information, reference the wikipedia article on [Gothic Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction).

This corpora is composed of "Classical Gothic" fiction.

A very broad overview of the "Classical Gothic" timespan:

The timespan starts from the mid 18th century with "the first Gothic Novel," *The Castle of Otranto* (published 1764).

Its heyday continues throughout the 19th century with the broader Romantic movement -- Jane Austen notably satirizes the entire Gothic/Romantic genre in *Northanger Abbey* (published 1817).

The late Victorian era (late 1800s - early 1900s) is a "soft end" to the "classics." Of particular note: Bram Stoker's *Dracula* (published 1897).

## What is Natural Language Processing?

According to this [article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/natural-language-processing/): "Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software."

## Attribution

The gothic corpora contains 134 texts originally gathered by [Caroline Winter](https://twitter.com/EditrixCaroline) and [Eleanor Stribling](https://twitter.com/eleanorstrib).

It was originally used to make [Gothic Colors](https://afternoon-taiga-69837.herokuapp.com/), a project to explore patterns in color usage in gothic literature.

Gothic Corpus is a fork of the Gothic Colors project.

The purpose of Gothic Corpus is to make freely available and easily accessible a Corpus for any Gothic-programmers to use in NLP.
