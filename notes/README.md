# gothic_corpus/notes

The two files here were preserved from the original Gothic Colors project.

They are kept here for reference.

## gothic_data.json

Meta-data on 411 Gothic Texts.

Only 130 texts have a `"Filename"`, which is the name of the file in `/corpora`.

Thus, this file may be referenced to find additional Gothic Literature to add to the corpora.

## gothic_texts.csv

I am preserving this file because it is a really good csv! It appears to be the file-output for data-collection in the OG Gothic Colors project. Yay, data!
